# Engangered Language Chatbot

Final project for the [Elements of AI - Building AI](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com) course by The University of Helsinki and Reaktor.

## Summary

Preserve endangered languages by creating chatbots that speak them.


## Background

The number of languages in the world is dwindling. Roughly 40% of the world's 7000 languages are endangered, with many haveing fewer than a thousand speakers. Linguists predict that this proportion will grow at an ever increasing rate in the future. More than half the world's population speak only 23 languages. Languages are not only languages. They are a culture and hold ideas and stories. By letting them die, we lose them. By keeping them around, we can celebrate the diversity of humans and learn about different peoples and their histories.

## How is it used?

Creating such chatbots would be useful for preserving human history and culture and would mainly be used by researchers or historians, though they could also be made available to the public through museums or online. They would also be a useful tool for teaching cultures and languages.


## Data sources and AI methods

Obviously, NLP solutions will be key to tackling this problem. However, creating these methods would not be as simple as it would seem, since most prior focus in NLP has been put on creating English speaking chatbots that show some levels of “intelligence”. Coming up with solutions for endangered languages would be particularly challenging, since every language handles the concept of language itself differently. Furthermore, many languages would not have a large enough corpus of text to train the model on, not to mention those languages which solely rely on speech. In these cases, data may need to be created by humans themselves by creating masses of written text in that language.


## Challenges

It is important to note that many people would not even know how to communicate with these chatbots, which would seemingly render them useless. However, a translation layer could potentially be added which would translate, for example, English into that endangered language, allowing communication with the chatbot. Text-to-speech is also another challenge that would need to be overcome, text is only half a language.


## Conclusion

But the question that we reach at the end is: is it even worth preserving all these languages? With so many dying, enormous amounts of resources would have to be allocated to create tailored NLP models, especially for those that do not have a large corpus of text. It is inevitable that countless languages will die. Some will remain preserved in books and texts by the actions of linguists, but could some be brought back to life again with a speaking population?


## What next?

To push this project forward, insight from various linguists and related professionals would be needed on whether indeed it would be useful in creating such chatbots. Furthermore, research is needed on what is currently possible with NLP methods, and what would be possible in the future; how easy it would be to create numerous models and models for various languages.
